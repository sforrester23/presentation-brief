# This is our README file for our presentation

Structure (not one slide each necessarily):
	Have an angle/point of view/question
	Introduction (should set out objectives)
	Background (if needed)
	Outline/agenda
	Sections (lead in, content, key takeaway – summary)
	Conclusion/summary (should mirror introduction and deliver on objective)
	Any questions?
